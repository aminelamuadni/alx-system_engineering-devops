# Command line for the win

## SFTP Transfer

To transfer the screenshots from my local environment to the sandbox, I utilized the SFTP command-line tool. Here's a brief overview of the steps I followed:

1. Initiated an SFTP session using: `sftp [username]@[hostname]`
2. Navigated to the target directory: `cd /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`
3. Uploaded the screenshots using the `put` command.
4. Exited the SFTP session.
